On the other hand, it's quite interesting yet unsurprising to see a majority of the married people drop out - as likely they dropped out to get married.

Of interest though is the decently larger percentage of graduates that started in the fall, which I'd argue is more normal (right after the previous 'year' of whatever they were doing, signifying a greater level of completion and tranquility of mind)."

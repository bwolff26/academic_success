    "Interesting idea re. \"...for that much data we'll nto always do a five-fold cross-validation...\" For sure if we're doing something more lengthy like SVMs, but I found that even running many many combinations on XGBoost to not take that long. Plus to be sure I still fail to see past the argument, \"Why not?\", considering the 'time save' to be negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, a pie chart. Eh, guess when just 3 it's fine - plus he still had the percentages inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Note that we cannot distinguish categorical features from integer features by looking at the data. We can only distinguish them by looking at the documentation!\" What a boss! Yeah, perhaps we can't have a simplified approach as we dreamed of in our youth (of 15 minutes ago).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shame he still did the barrage of distributions, but when he actually explains them!!! Plus, neat how he uses different colors for different types: integers, categories, and floats as blue, black, and green (bar, bar, histograms interestingly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, shame he didn't use the mask. Maybe he's not into it though. Plus, \"DISCLAIMER: It is very questionable whether one should compute correlations for categorical features, but we do it anyway.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, it just dawned on me - what's his code?!!? Sigh, I'll take the codeless explanation over code without it at least this time. Shame, as I must admit I'd prefer the later anydays - as who cares how much of a smooth criminal we're dealng wth if we have no clue how he got there (by moonwalking, excuse me).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shame too as he made the heatmap more readible by multiplyng by 10. A bit ironic considering the name of the visual though.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting bit of comparing the top feature's distribution in the train/test and validatio data. Suppose it's worthy to do. Unsure how he used cirriculate units, which we do know to be the most significant. Perhaps via correlations; oh wait, that's pure unsupervised there - no target in sight...\n",
    "\n",
    "Very nice useage of decision trees to highlight pragmatically why that feature is so significan.\n",

    "----- \n",
    "\n",
    "Not up to it at the moment, but lkely worthwhie to make noe of his top model, ensemble (ridge) which was .002 greater than ours. Plus, what's these 'tuned' he keeps on mentioning? Furthermore, what's DART? Also, shoutout to him using extra trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Shoutout out again for him stating his conclusion. Besides eliminating useless, he wants to create additional.How though - do you mean via engineering or going into the field? Love how he goaded people to actually tune models. And, fun last oe, \"Find a better ensembling method.\" Likely reserved for the phders. Might be there one day, you never know...\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall I am quite pleased with his work, albit not adding any new code here; adding and cemeting my knowledge.\n"

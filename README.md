# academic_success
From Kaggle's Playground:S4E6. They've been synthesizing their data, with the original's data dictionary found below.

## Introduction

Unlike previous ones, I'm going all out for this one. Thankfully, I am quite interested in this topic and have plenty of features to play with.

Might as well aim to do all sorts of unsupervised learning as well, make visualisations (and learn how to spell that word), etc. Coding wise I'm quite adept in my opinion (at least considering the meager amount of time I've befriended the Python), however when it comes to knowing packages, 'current data science news', and visualizationn there's still what to improve... So, let's do it (6/18/24)!

## Various Notes

Arguably shouldn't be here, but regardless:
cedai:
Drop 'education special needs'
